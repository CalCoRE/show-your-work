    "We chose to focus on South Lake Tahoe, CA because it has an especially *skewed* distribution of home prices, with a few very expensive homes pulling the mean up well above the median. While this is an especially dramatic example, home prices are typically skewed in this way. This is why often you will see the median home price reported in real estate listings or in the news, rather than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about other ways that you can explore the distribution of home prices. You might be interested in other `cities`, entire `states` or in other aspects of housing such as looking at the distribution of housing prices based on the number of `bedrooms` or the `house_size`. \n",

    "* a subset of homes with a wide range of what you would call \"typical\" prices.\n",

    "Now, choose at least one of these scenarios to explore. You will filter the dataset to reflect the patterns you expect, and use the rest of the code to test your predictions about what would happen. [Click here](#set-housing-data) to go back to the top of this section and get started."

    "* **6.SP.A.2 & 3:** Understand that a set of data collected to answer a statistical question has a distribution which can be described by its center, spread, and overall shape. Recognize that a measure of center for a numerical data set summarizes all of its values with a single number.\n",
    "* **HSS.ID.A.1, 2, & 3:** Represent data with plots on the real number line (histograms). Use statistics appropriate to the shape of the data distribution to compare center (median, mean) of different data sets. Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context of the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points (outliers).\n",

    "### Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)\n",
    "* **Science and Engineering Practice 4: Analyzing and Interpreting Data:** This notebook provides a direct application of this practice, as students must analyze data using computational tools to describe a dataset and understand its variability.\n",
    "* **Crosscutting Concept 3: Scale, Proportion, and Quantity:** Understanding measures of center and spread is fundamental to describing a system quantitatively. This is especially true when discussing the impact of outliers, which highlights the importance of scale."
