    "* **6.SP.A.2 & 3:** Understand that a set of data collected to answer a statistical question has a distribution which can be described by its center, spread, and overall shape. Recognize that a measure of center for a numerical data set summarizes all of its values with a single number.\n",

    "* **HSS.ID.A.1, 2, & 3:** Represent data with plots on the real number line (histograms). Use statistics appropriate to the shape of the data distribution to compare center (median, mean) of different data sets. Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context of the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points (outliers).\n",
