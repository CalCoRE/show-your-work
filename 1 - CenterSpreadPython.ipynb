    "* **Economics:** Individual income in a country is famously skewed. Most people earn a modest income, while a very few earn extremely high incomes, pulling the mean income far above the median.\n",
    "* **Biology:** The number of offspring produced by individuals in a species is often skewed. Most individuals may have 1-2 offspring, while a few \"super-reproducers\" might have many, many more.\n",
    "* **Internet & Social Media:** The number of \"likes\" or \"shares\" on a post is highly skewed. The vast majority of posts get very few interactions, while a tiny fraction go viral and get millions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all these cases, understanding the difference between mean and median, and being able to see the shape of the data with a histogram, is essential for drawing accurate conclusions."

    "### Common Core State Standards for Mathematics\n",
    "* **6.SP.A.2 & 3:** Understand that a set of data collected to answer a statistical question has a distribution which can be described by its center, spread, and overall shape. Recognize that a measure of center for a numerical data set summarizes all of its values with a single number.\n",
    "* **HSS.ID.A.1, 2, & 3:** Represent data with plots on the real number line (histograms). Use statistics appropriate to the shape of the data distribution to compare center (median, mean) of different data sets. Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context of the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points (outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)\n",
    "* **Science and Engineering Practice 4: Analyzing and Interpreting Data:** This notebook provides a direct application of this practice, as students must analyze data using computational tools to describe a dataset and understand its variability.\n",
    "* **Crosscutting Concept 3: Scale, Proportion, and Quantity:** Understanding measures of center and spread is fundamental to describing a system quantitatively. This is especially true when discussing the impact of outliers, which highlights the importance of scale."
