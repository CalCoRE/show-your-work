    "### 🔹 Experimental Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a cart sitting on a **horizontal track** (completely flat, no incline). You apply a force to the cart, and it accelerates along the track. However, friction between the cart and the track opposes the motion.\n",

    "### 🔹 The Physics Behind It\n",
    "\n",
    "When you push the cart, Newton's Second Law tells us:\n",
    "\n",
    "**F_net = ma**\n",
    "\n",
    "But the net force isn't just your applied force—it's your applied force minus the friction:\n",

    "**F_applied - F_friction = ma**\n",

    "**F_applied = ma + F_friction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the key relationship we'll explore! Notice that:\n",
    "- **F_applied** is what you control (you decide how hard to push)\n",
    "- **a** is what you measure (how fast the cart accelerates)\n",
    "- **m** (mass) and **F_friction** are what you're trying to discover from the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What You'll Do\n",
    "\n",
    "In this virtual lab, you'll:\n",
    "1. Apply different forces to the cart and measure the resulting accelerations\n",
    "2. Collect force-acceleration data points (with some measurement noise, just like real experiments!)\n",
    "3. Use linear regression to find the best-fit line through your data\n",
    "4. Extract the mass (from the slope) and friction (from the y-intercept) from that line\n"

    "\n",
    "Before we begin finding the best-fit line, let's understand what we're working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 The Physics Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "In our experiment with a cart on a horizontal plane, we're exploring Newton's Second Law of Motion. When we apply a force to the cart, it accelerates. However, friction also acts on the cart, opposing its motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between force and acceleration can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**F = ma + F_friction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **F** is the total force applied to the cart (in Newtons, N)\n",
    "- **m** is the mass of the cart (in kilograms, kg)\n",
    "- **a** is the acceleration of the cart (in meters per second squared, m/s²)\n",
    "- **F_friction** is the force of friction opposing the motion (in Newtons, N)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 The Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 0, you generated experimental data by applying different forces to a cart and measuring the resulting accelerations. Your virtual sensors recorded pairs of values: for each acceleration you measured, you also recorded the force that was applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the typical setup for a physics lab experiment—you control one variable (force) and measure the response (acceleration).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Working Backwards\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the key insight: In the real experiment, you don't directly know the mass of the cart or the amount of friction. Instead, you have a collection of force-acceleration data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task is to work backwards from this data to determine (or \"guess\") what the mass and friction values must be.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we rearrange our physics formula slightly, we can see it as a linear relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "**F = m × a + F_friction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks like the familiar equation for a line: **y = mx + b**, where:\n",
    "- **y** (force) depends on\n",
    "- **x** (acceleration)\n",
    "- **m** (the slope) represents the mass\n",
    "- **b** (the y-intercept) represents the friction force\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Finding the Best-Fit Line\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the mass and friction from your experimental data, you need to find the line that best fits through your data points. The slope of that line will tell you the mass, and where it crosses the y-axis will tell you the friction. \n",
    "\n",

    "### 🔸 Understanding Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've tried fitting the line manually, let's understand what linear regression does at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 What is Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a mathematical method for finding the best straight line that fits through a set of data points. When you have data that appears to follow a linear pattern (like our force-acceleration relationship), linear regression finds the line that minimizes the overall \"error\" between the line and your actual data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 How Does It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about what you just did with the sliders: you tried to adjust the slope (mass) and y-intercept (friction) to make the blue line pass as close as possible to all the black data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "You probably noticed that it's impossible to make the line pass through every point perfectly—there's always some distance between the line and each point. Those red vertical lines you saw represent these distances, called **\"residuals.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression does exactly what you were trying to do, but it uses mathematics to find the optimal values automatically. Specifically, it uses a method called **\"least squares,\"** which finds the line that minimizes the sum of the squares of all those residual distances. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why squares?** Squaring the distances ensures that:\n",
    "1. All distances are positive (so they don't cancel each other out)\n",
    "2. Larger errors are penalized more heavily (a point that's far from the line contributes more to the total error)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 What Does It Give Us?\n",
    "\n",
    "When linear regression analyzes your force-acceleration data, it calculates:\n",
    "- **The slope (m)**: This tells us the mass of the cart\n",
    "- **The y-intercept (b)**: This tells us the force of friction\n",
    "- **A measure of fit quality**: How well the line matches the data (often expressed as R², which ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being a perfect fit)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Why Use It?\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can get close by eye and with sliders, linear regression gives you the mathematically optimal answer. It's also fast, consistent, and can handle much larger datasets than you could analyze manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why scientists and engineers use computational tools for data analysis—they provide precise, reproducible results.\n",
