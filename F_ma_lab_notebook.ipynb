    "## 🎯 PURPOSE: Why Use Computational Notebooks for Data Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational notebooks, like **Jupyter Notebooks**, offer a unique blend of **narrative text**, **executable code**, and **visualizations** all in one place. For analyzing experimental science data, this is incredibly powerful:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reproducibility:** A notebook captures the entire analysis process—the data, the cleaning steps, the calculations (like linear regression), and the final graph. Anyone can re-run the exact analysis and get the same results. In science, this is crucial for verifying findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Live Documentation:** Unlike static lab reports or spreadsheets, the code itself is right next to the explanation. You can explain *why* you are performing a linear regression and then execute the regression in the next cell. This makes the **methodology transparent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Iterative Exploration:** It's easy to change a single line of code (e.g., to exclude an outlier, switch the regression type) and immediately see the effect on the graph and results. This encourages **scientific curiosity and testing hypotheses**."

    "## 📚 Understanding Linear Regression: Finding the \"Best Fit\" Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we run our first regression, let's understand what **linear regression** actually does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Linear Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear regression** is a statistical method that finds the **\"line of best fit\"** through a set of data points. Imagine you have a scatter plot of points, and you want to draw a straight line that comes as close as possible to all of them. Linear regression does this mathematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Goal: Minimize Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression algorithm finds the line that **minimizes the total squared distance** between the line and all data points. Think of it like this:\n",
    "- For each data point, measure how far it is from the line (vertically)\n",
    "- Square that distance (to make all distances positive and emphasize larger errors)\n",
    "- Add up all these squared distances\n",
    "- The \"best fit\" line is the one that makes this total as small as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Get from Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform linear regression, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Slope ($m$):** The steepness of the line. In our experiment, this represents the **mass** of the cart system.\n",
    "2. **Y-Intercept ($b$):** Where the line crosses the y-axis. In our experiment, this represents the **friction force**.\n",
    "3. **R-squared ($R^2$):** A measure of how well the line fits the data (we'll explain this in detail below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The line of best fit follows the familiar equation: $y = mx + b$, where:\n",
    "- $y$ is the dependent variable (Force, in our case)\n",
    "- $x$ is the independent variable (Acceleration, in our case)\n",
    "- $m$ is the slope (Mass)\n",
    "- $b$ is the y-intercept (Friction)\n",

    "After running the regression, you saw an **R-squared** value. Let's understand what this important statistic means.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is R-squared?\n",
    "\n",
    "**R-squared** (also written as $R^2$ or \"R-squared\") is a number between 0 and 1 that tells us **what percentage of the variation in the data is explained by our linear model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting R-squared Values\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$R^2 = 1.0$ (or 100%):** Perfect fit! All data points lie exactly on the line. This is extremely rare in real experiments.\n",
    "- **$R^2 = 0.95$ (or 95%):** Excellent fit! The line explains 95% of the variation. Most data points are very close to the line.\n",
    "- **$R^2 = 0.80$ (or 80%):** Good fit. The line explains 80% of the variation. Some scatter, but a clear linear trend.\n",
    "- **$R^2 = 0.50$ (or 50%):** Moderate fit. The line explains only half the variation. There's significant scatter.\n",
    "- **$R^2 = 0.0$ (or 0%):** No linear relationship. The line doesn't explain any of the variation—the data is completely random with respect to the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Our Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "For our Force vs. Acceleration data:\n",
    "- A high $R^2$ (close to 1.0) means the data follows Newton's Second Law very well—the relationship is strongly linear.\n",
    "- A low $R^2$ (far from 1.0) suggests either:\n",
    "  - Experimental errors (outliers, measurement mistakes)\n",
