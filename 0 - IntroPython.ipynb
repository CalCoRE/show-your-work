    "# Key Takeaways about Computational Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "One strength of computational notebooks is that they can provide **clear models of code**, while also allowing the space to **explore and make discoveries with data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another is that as you learn more about the code, you can begin to create your own **real, integrated data stories**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working in a notebook is a new skill. The most important thing you can bring to it is a **productive mindset**. Encourage these habits of mind in yourself and your students:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **üí° Embrace Tinkering**  \n",
    "  You can‚Äôt permanently break anything. If your notebook gets messy or you get stuck, you can always reset everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **üß† Code as Expression**  \n",
    "  Students should read and change the code in ways that reflect _scientific ideas_ about what they are exploring. Code can help externalize and test their ideas about science _and_ data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **üìù Document Your Journey**  \n",
    "  Use text cells as your lab notebook. Write down your questions before you write code. This practice of ‚Äúdocumenting as you go‚Äù is a powerful skill for thinking and for collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **‚ùå Errors are Your Friends**  \n",
    "  Everyone gets error messages. An error is not a sign of failure; it is a **clue**. Learning to read error messages is a core part of learning to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **üîç Be Curious**  \n",
    "  This is the most important disposition of all. A notebook is a tool for asking and answering questions. Use it to explore your curiosity and empower your students to explore theirs."
