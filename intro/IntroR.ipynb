These notebooks are typically used to present investigations of data through an interactive document with runnable code, corresponding output (like tables and graphs), and explanatory text and pictures all in one place. They create a complete story of an analysis.\n\nLet's try a quick example to see what we mean. Below, the grey rectangle is what's called a \"code block\" or \"code cell.\"\n\nEach line of code below is followed by a comment (<span style='color:green'>_#like this_</span>). The hash tag tells the computer to ignore the text that follows -- it's meant only for human readers, to help make sense of the code.

It's about the process, and about the decisions you make when you make observations, build models, make calculations, or collect data. Notebooks can make this process transparent. Anyone can see the exact steps—the data, the code, the model, the reasoning—that led to a conclusion. This is called **reproducibility**, and it's a cornerstone of modern scientific practice.","metadata":{}},{"id":"ea448e03-a1b7-4d2b-81eb-1c7daf96deb7","cell_type":"markdown","source":"Another important feature of notebooks is they can allow students to create simulations that have probabilistic elements, modeling **uncertainty** in science and statistics.

This kind of transparency is necessary for good scientific and statistical work, and can be very useful for students, too. It demystifies data analysis, showing it as a series of deliberate, understandable steps. It directly connects to the ways that science and math education should work: by having students experience how knowledge is built, revised, and validated. And, it allows students to not just consume information, but to interact with it, change it, and ask their own questions.\n\nThe biggest hurdle is the initial learning curve. Learning the basics of a coding language can feel intimidating. That's why we are here! However, as you'll see, you don't need to be a software developer to do powerful things.","metadata":{}},{"id":"094fab14-a83e-4d30-8661-2c92705e9396","cell_type":"markdown","source":"### How do notebooks compare to other tools I use in my classroom?\n\nYou already use tools for calculation and data in your classroom. How might notebooks like this one fit in?\n\n* **Paper & Pencil** activities are classic, inexpensive, highly accessible, flexible, and excellent for sketching ideas or working through a single problem. However, they can become unweildy when you want students to work with large datasets, or to tinker with models or simulations that are difficult to reproduce with hands-on materials.\n\n* **Spreadsheets** like Excel or Google Sheets are great for entering data, simple formulas, and basic charts, and it's good for students to become comfortable with spreadsheets as a popular professional tool. However with spreadsheets, the *process* and *story* is hidden. It's hard to track all the steps, clicks, and ideas that created a chart. \n\n* **Scientific and Graphing Calculators** like TI-85 or Desmos are best for manual calculations and graphing functions. But these tools are not designed for more flexible analysis of datasets with multiple variables and are limited in terms of visualization and tracking process.\n\n* **Interactive Visualization Tools** like CODAP, Tuva, and DataClassroom make it very easy to quickly explore patterns and relationships with data through menu-based and drag-and-drop methods. Some also include tools to help you to document the process. However, these tools are designed specifically for education, they are not used in the professional world. They are more open-ended, which can make it harder to focus on certain details of their exploration.\n\nThe main point is that notebooks integrate the _narrative_ (text and pictures), the _analysis_ (code), and _results_ (your tables and plots) into a single, interactive story.","metadata":{}},{"id":"dc825301-7506-4459-b146-25f7c41cb1ab","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# A ❄︎Cool❄︎ Investigation: Penguin Populations\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\nThis activity is designed to give you a little taste of what it can feel like to explore questions with data using Jupyter notebooks.

A dataset is a structured collection of information. In our dataset, each **case**, or row in the table, describes a single penguin.

In our dataset, some of the attributes are:\n\n* `species` (the species of the penguin observed)\n* `island` (the island where the penguin was observed)\n* `bill_length_mm` (the length of the penguin's bill in millimeters)\n* `flipper_length_mm` (the length of the penguin's flipper in millimeters)\n\nThis simple, consistent structure is the key to making data analysis work.","metadata":{}},{"id":"4b9fd887-df52-499d-950c-0742f9406579","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Let's get started\n\nYou will use code to explore the penguin data.

Organisms, and populations of organisms, are dependent on their environmental interactions both with other living things and with nonliving factors (LS2.A).\n\n* _Analyzing and Interpreting Data_. Construct, analyze, and/or interpret graphical displays of data and/or large data sets to identify linear and nonlinear relationships (MS).\n\n* _Developing and Using Models_. Develop, revise, and/or use a model based on evidence to illustrate and/or predict the relationships between systems or between components of a system (HS).","metadata":{}},{"id":"7771dbb3-d9bf-466c-a752-64da6a78737f","cell_type":"markdown","source":"One strength of computational notebooks is that they can provide clear models of code, while also allowing the space to explore and make discoveries with data. Another is that as you learn more about the code, you can begin to create your own real, integrated data stories.\n\nWorking in a notebook is a new skill. The most important thing you can bring to it is a productive mindset. Encourage these habits of mind in yourself and your students.\n\n* **Embrace Tinkering:** What happens if you change some of the code you are introduced to below? Try it! The worst that can happen is you get an error or a weird-looking graph. You can't permanently break anything. If your notebook gets messy or you get stuck, you can always reset everything.\n* **Code as Expression:** Students should read and change the code in ways that reflect _scientific ideas_ about what they are exploring. Just like data  can provide evidence in science, and science helps explain data, code can help externalize and test data and science ideas.\n* **Document Your Journey:** Use text cells as your lab notebook. Write down your questions before you write code. After you get an output, write a sentence about what you think it means. This practice of \"documenting as you go\" is a powerful skill for thinking and for collaboration.\n* **Errors are Your Friends:** You *will* get error messages. Everyone who codes does. An error is not a sign of failure; it is a clue. Read it carefully. Often, it will tell you exactly where you made a typo. Learning to read error messages is a core part of learning to code.\n* **Be Curious:** This is the most important disposition of all. A notebook is a tool for asking and answering questions. Use it to explore your curiosity and empower your students to explore theirs.","metadata":{}},{"id":"86b31e71-ef8b-4ea2-ad9c-3f98ba37e0a0","cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Credits\n\nThis notebook was developed as part of \"Show York Work\" (SyW), a research and development project at UC Berkeley to introduce computational notebooks to K-12 educators. \n                                                                      \nThe SyW team includes, in alphabetical order: Pavritha Arun Anand, Sun Young Ban, Chul Huang, JungMin Shin, Michelle Wilkerson, and Xiaoyue Zhang.\n\nPreliminary drafting of the notebook was done with the assistance of Google Gemini Pro 2.5. \n\nThe Palmer Penguins dataset was downloaded from https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins, lisenced under CC1.0 Universal.
